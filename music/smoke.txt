有一种蠢蠢欲动的味道
Yǒuyī zhǒng chǔnchǔnyùdòng de wèidào
Google: There is a taste of just around the corner
Lyrics: There's a kind of tantalising smell

种 zhǒng is 'kind of'. Is it a measure word? Yes: For people/books/ things
蠢蠢欲 is stupid
蠢蠢欲动 is 'just round the corner' ... tantalising is good
味道 wèidào is taste / flavour / smell

thre is one '
让我忍不住把你燃烧
Ràng wǒ rěn bù zhù bǎ nǐ ránshāo
让 Ràng concede/let
忍 rěn endure
住 zhù live / reside / *stop*
把 bǎ co-verb means that the burning applies to the main object but not main verb
你燃烧 bǎ nǐ ránshāo
Google: So I can not help but burn you
Lyrics: I can't help but light you up

把周围的人都赶跑对我也不好
Bǎ zhōuwéi de rén dōu gǎn pǎo duì wǒ yě bù hǎo
It 's not good for me to drive around
我知道我知道我戒不掉
Wǒ zhīdào wǒ zhīdào wǒ jiè bù diào

戒不掉花非花的情调心瘾叫我无处可逃
Jiè bù diào huā fēi huā de qíngdiào xīn yǐn jiào wǒ wú chù kě táo
戒不掉 Jiè bù diào can not quit
戒 Jiè give up/stop
花 flower

Can not stop the flower non-flower mood addiction called me nowhere to escape
戒不掉 雾非雾的线条梦想颠倒
Jiè bù diào wù fēi wù de  xiàntiáo mèngxiǎng diāndǎo
Can not afford to fog fog lines dream of upside down
I can not think of it
梦幻还是闻到泡影还是看到
满足指缝一时的无聊
变成脉膊跳动的倚靠
吻着你就忘了烦恼你变成烦恼
想不到想不到我戒不掉
Xiǎngbùdào xiǎngbùdào wǒ jiè bù diào
I can not think of it
戒不掉吻你没有必要可又有什么更重要

Jiè bù diào wěn nǐ méiyǒu bìyào kě yòu yǒu shé me gèng zhòngyào
It 's not necessary to have nothing to do

戒不掉枉我自栩骄傲不拿着你就会烦躁
戒不掉灭了味觉就好可我的心没那么高
放下你假装拈花微笑问题在于
如何平伏心跳平伏我的心跳


There's a kind of tantalising smell
I can't help but light you up
It sends nearby people running
It's not good for me
I know, I know
I can't kick the habit

Can't kick the habit
Flowery sentiments
I can't escape the addiction
Can't kick the habit
Foggy contours
My dreams have been turned upside down
[I] can smell it in my dreams
[I] can still see its shadows

[You] satisfy the momentary idleness between my fingers
[You've] become the support on which my beating pulse relies
When I kiss you I forget my worries
You've become my worry
I never thought, never thought
[That] I'd be unable to kick the habit

Can't kick the habit
[I] don't need to kiss you
Yet what could be more important?
Can't kick the habit
[I] was so proud of myself
[Now] I'm irritable when I'm not holding you

Can't kick the habit
If only my sense of taste could be extinguished
Yet I cannot bear to do this
[I could] put you down
And pretend to smile while picking a flower
The problem lies in
How to calm my heartbeat, calm my heartbeat
How to calm my heartbeat, calm my heartbeat
