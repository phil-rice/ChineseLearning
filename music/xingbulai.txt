ENGLISH TRANSLATION :

Can't differentiate the day
can't see the night
Mood's cold going to and fro at night
Can't differentiate right and wrong
Can't see perfection
10 times drunk
7 times exhausted
its not wish to sleep soundly
oh can't wake up
wake up you still won't be there
its not can't wake up
oh wake up i'll still stare into space

Friends say that I'm prettier at night
just because they can't see my sober face
Friends say that i'm more cold & glamourous at night
just because they can't see my grief
the sun rises
oh can't wake up
wake up still there's no future
the moon light beamed down
oh can't wake up
wake up i'll still stare into space
