běn is the measure word for book
xiǎo is small so 小说 is small 'speak' or novel

Note that the subject is often missing.

呢 ne is the main topic

'Turn the question around'
Nǐ ne 你呢 , you?

A question like  干嘛 'gànmá' is 'softened' made more 'hey it's OK'
你干嘛, Nǐ gàn mais 'what are you doing'

Nǐ zài nǎ 你在哪 is 'where are you;
Nǐ zài nǎ ne is 'where are you going with an emoji of being soft'

Then you can stick a 呢 on the end.

For example
你呢 Nǐ ne is 'you?'
电话呢 Diànhuà  ne is 'what happened to my phone?' (I think)
人呢  Rén ne 'where did all these people go'
出租车呢 Chūzū chē ne 'wh'
