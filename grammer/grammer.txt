Sometimes we may want to say something is "not even the least bit [adjective]."
For example, we might say in English: "I am not at all hungry."
In Chinese, we can use
           一点也不 (yīdiǎnr yě bù) or
           一点都不 (yīdiǎnr dōu bù) to express "not at all [adjective]."

那个 问题 一点儿 也 不 难 。
Nàge wèntí yīdiǎnr yě bù nán.
That question isn't difficult at all.
这个 菜 一点 都 不 好吃 。
Zhège cài yīdiǎn dōu bù hǎochī.
This dish isn't tasty at all.
我 同事 一点 都 不 幽默 。
Wǒ tóngshì yīdiǎn dōu bù yōumò.
My colleague is not humorous at all.
这个 笑话 一点 也 不 好笑 。
Zhège xiàohuà yīdiǎn yě bù hǎoxiào.
This joke isn't funny at all.
